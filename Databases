# Installation and download database

The main advantage of MetaPatho is that it combines high accuracy with simplicity, speed, and user-friendliness. 

MetaPatho does not require the installation of complex software or environments and operates in just two steps: 


Step 1: download the bacterial pathogen genome database; 

Before running MetaPatho, users must download the database they need:

MetaPatho-HBPDB: MetaPatho-HBPDB.v1.0.dmnd.7z and MetaPatho-HBPDB.v1.0.anno

MetaPatho-PBPDB: MetaPatho-PBPDB.v1.0.dmnd.7z and MetaPatho-PBPDB.v1.0.anno

The human (MetaPatho-HBPDB) and plant (MetaPatho-PBPDB) bacterial pathogen databases have been deposited at the Figshare (https://figshare.com/s/753d3906f6faf1986d6a)



Step 2: install DIAMOND in the computing environment, as MetaPatho relies on DIAMOND for database alignment.

conda create -n MetaPatho
source activate MetaPatho
conda install diamond=2.1.8

About the DIAMOND:

DIAMOND is a  high-throughput program for aligning DNA reads or protein sequences against a protein reference database such as NR, at up to 20,000 times the speed of BLAST, with high sensitivity.

See the DIAMOND github page: https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond
